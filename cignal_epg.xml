Pat and Jess meet the eccentric Ned Glenn at his workshop and wrestle with the crate containing the heavy engine to get it aboard the plane. Back in Greendale the villagers are only too delighted to take all of Ted's weird and wonderful inventions off his hands but the more inventions that go, the more gloomy Ted gets. After a trip over a very bumpy field and flight in the plane, Pat finally delivers the engine to a now very sad Ted. He's depressed because he loves to tinkering with things, and now he has nothing left to tinker with. Maybe the engine will cheer him up but when Pat takes the side off the crate, just a heap of engine parts spill out. The engine was shaken apart on the journey. Pat is very sorry but Ted is delighted. Now he has something to tinker with again! Mission accomplished!</desc>

You won’t find the same-old talking heads recycling platitudes; instead thought-provoking guests to debate and explore key issues of today’s world. Using virtual reality graphics to bring subjects to life, Stephen will navigate through subjects ranging from “Prove That Climate Change Exists”  to “Who Will Win the Race to Space”. Opposing views will be given opportunity to flourish and develop into a meaningful conversation. 
The Agenda: No nonsense talk; Challenging perceptions.

Pat and Jess set off to Cornwall to collect this very large special delivery in the SDS Plane whilst Ted sets about giving away all of his old inventions to the people of Greendale in order to clear out enough space for the engine. Pat and Jess meet the eccentric Ned Glenn at his workshop and wrestle with the crate containing the heavy engine to get it aboard the plane. Back in Greendale the villagers are only too delighted to take all of Ted's weird and wonderful inventions off his hands but the more inventions that go, the more gloomy Ted gets. After a trip over a very bumpy field and flight in the plane, Pat finally delivers the engine to a now very sad Ted. He's depressed because he loves to tinkering with things, and now he has nothing left to tinker with. Maybe the engine will cheer him up but when Pat takes the side off the crate, just a heap of engine parts spill out. The engine was shaken apart on the journey. Pat is very sorry but Ted is delighted. Now he has something to tinker with again! Mission accomplished!</desc>

Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch.

    <desc lang="en">In the future, North America is no more. In its place has risen Panem, a divided nation split into 12 districts. Every year, each district selects a teen of each gender (called "Tributes") to test their worth in a competition known as the Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When her younger sister is selected as District 12's latest "Tribute," Katniss volunteers to take her place, and trains under hard-drinking former Hunger Games champion Haymitch Abernathy to sharpen her killer instincts. Now in order to survive the game and emerge the victor, this young combatant must put all of her skills to the ultimate test.</desc>
