There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness. As the season draws to a close, Grissom undergoes surgery to correct this problem, however the results of the operation remain unclear until the beginning of season four.</desc>

Every year, each district selects a teen of each gender (called "Tributes") to test their worth in a competition known as the Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When her younger sister is selected as District 12's latest "Tribute," Katniss volunteers to take her place, and trains under hard-drinking former Hunger Games champion Haymitch Abernathy to sharpen her killer instincts. Now in order to survive the game and emerge the victor, this young combatant must put all of her skills to the ultimate test.</desc>
