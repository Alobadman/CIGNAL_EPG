    <desc lang="en">Based on PD Eastman's classic children’s book, Go, Dog. Go! Follows 6-year-old dog, Tag Barker, on her hilarious adventures in the city of Pawston, a fun-loving community of dogs on the go. Tag is a skilled mechanic and loves anything that goes. With her ingenuity and creativity, Tag can go as far as any plan will take her, always with her best friend, Scooch Pooch, by her side. Scooch’s easy-going nature is the perfect counterbalance to Tag’s high-octane energy. But as much as Tag loves to go, she’s often reminded that it's family, friends and neighbors that really fuel a community.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Slave Hunters</title>
    <desc lang="en">Slaves fervently wishing to live like a human being VS. Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Clash Of The Titans</title>
    <desc lang="en">In CLASH OF THE TITANS, the ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation, Avatar) stars as the Greek hero Perseus in this spectacular retelling of the classic myth (and '80s cult classic film). Born of a god, but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from the clutches of Hades (Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes -- Harry Potter films), the vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, he volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Oscar nominee Liam Neeson -- Batman Begins) and unleash hell on earth. With a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will triumph only if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.</desc>
