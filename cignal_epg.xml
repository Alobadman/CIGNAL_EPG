Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age.

Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</title><desc lang="en">The Slave Hunters</desc></programme><programme start="20250422175000 +0000" stop="20250422193000 +0000" channel="44B03994-C303-4ACE-997C-91CAC493D0FC"><title lang="en">The true classic of the century is born again!

Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</title><desc lang="en">The Slave Hunters</desc></programme><programme start="20250422012500 +0000" stop="20250422020000 +0000" channel="68C2D95A-A2A4-4C2B-93BE-41893C61210C"><title lang="en">A life story of three friends, one who is rich, one who is poor, and one who wishes to be rich, along with their families.</title><desc lang="en">Good Luck!</desc></programme><programme start="20250422020000 +0000" stop="20250422024000 +0000" channel="68C2D95A-A2A4-4C2B-93BE-41893C61210C"><title lang="en">A story of a woman who realizes the meaning of true revenge while she has been used as a fake daughter by her enemy.</title><desc lang="en">Cinderella Game</desc></programme><programme start="20250422024000 +0000" stop="20250422032000 +0000" channel="68C2D95A-A2A4-4C2B-93BE-41893C61210C"><title lang="en">A mystery romance with a woman who wanted to have the world and a woman who risked everything for revenge.</title><desc lang="en">Snow White's Revenge</desc></programme><programme start="20250422032000 +0000" stop="20250422043500 +0000" channel="68C2D95A-A2A4-4C2B-93BE-41893C61210C"><title lang="en">A family story about five brothers and a sister-in-law who suddenly became the head of the family after her husband's unexpected death.</title><desc lang="en">For Eagle Brothers</desc></programme><programme start="20250422043500 +0000" stop="20250422044000 +0000" channel="68C2D95A-A2A4-4C2B-93BE-41893C61210C"><title lang="en">The true classic of the century is born again!

There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness.

Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age.

Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</title><desc lang="en">The Slave Hunters</desc></programme><programme start="20250422175000 +0000" stop="20250422193000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">The true classic of the century is born again!

There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness. As the season draws to a close, Grissom undergoes surgery to correct this problem, however the results of the operation remain unclear until the beginning of season four.</title><desc lang="en">CSI S3 E04 - A Little Murder</desc></programme><programme start="20250422220000 +0000" stop="20250422230000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Homicide: Life on the Street portrays the raw emotions in the life on the front line and also compels character-driven drama with emotional depth.</title><desc lang="en">Homicide: Life On The Street S2 E16 - Law &amp; Disorder</desc></programme><programme start="20250422230000 +0000" stop="20250423000000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">David Suchet portrays the inspired Belgian investigator, Hercule Poirot; creating a unique catalogue of timeless crime fiction.</title><desc lang="en">Agatha Christie's Poirot S6 E07 - Dumb Witness (Part 1)</desc></programme><programme start="20250422000000 +0000" stop="20250422003000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">News Live</desc></programme><programme start="20250422003000 +0000" stop="20250422010000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Inspirational and provocative stories providing a fresh and informative insight into the world's key events as they impact on the lives of ordinary people.</title><desc lang="en">Witness</desc></programme><programme start="20250422010000 +0000" stop="20250422013000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">News Live</desc></programme><programme start="20250422013000 +0000" stop="20250422020000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Trump takes on the U.S.'s enemies and friends - ferocious tariff wars with China and scathing rhetoric on Canada.</title><desc lang="en">The Listening Post</desc></programme><programme start="20250422020000 +0000" stop="20250422030000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">Newshour</desc></programme><programme start="20250422030000 +0000" stop="20250422033000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">News Live</desc></programme><programme start="20250422033000 +0000" stop="20250422040000 +0000" channel="B741DD7A-A7F8-4F8A-A549-9EF411020F9D"><title lang="en">Beyond the headlines to the heart of the news of the day.

Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</title><desc lang="en">The Slave Hunters</desc></programme><programme start="20250422012500 +0000" stop="20250422020000 +0000" channel="C0B38DBD-BE4F-4044-9D85-D827D8DC64C4"><title lang="en">A life story of three friends, one who is rich, one who is poor, and one who wishes to be rich, along with their families.</title><desc lang="en">Good Luck!</desc></programme><programme start="20250422020000 +0000" stop="20250422024000 +0000" channel="C0B38DBD-BE4F-4044-9D85-D827D8DC64C4"><title lang="en">A story of a woman who realizes the meaning of true revenge while she has been used as a fake daughter by her enemy.</title><desc lang="en">Cinderella Game</desc></programme><programme start="20250422024000 +0000" stop="20250422032000 +0000" channel="C0B38DBD-BE4F-4044-9D85-D827D8DC64C4"><title lang="en">A mystery romance with a woman who wanted to have the world and a woman who risked everything for revenge.</title><desc lang="en">Snow White's Revenge</desc></programme><programme start="20250422032000 +0000" stop="20250422043500 +0000" channel="C0B38DBD-BE4F-4044-9D85-D827D8DC64C4"><title lang="en">A family story about five brothers and a sister-in-law who suddenly became the head of the family after her husband's unexpected death.</title><desc lang="en">For Eagle Brothers</desc></programme><programme start="20250422043500 +0000" stop="20250422044000 +0000" channel="C0B38DBD-BE4F-4044-9D85-D827D8DC64C4"><title lang="en">The true classic of the century is born again!

There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness.

Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</title><desc lang="en">The Slave Hunters</desc></programme><programme start="20250422012500 +0000" stop="20250422020000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">A life story of three friends, one who is rich, one who is poor, and one who wishes to be rich, along with their families.</title><desc lang="en">Good Luck!</desc></programme><programme start="20250422020000 +0000" stop="20250422024000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">A story of a woman who realizes the meaning of true revenge while she has been used as a fake daughter by her enemy.</title><desc lang="en">Cinderella Game</desc></programme><programme start="20250422024000 +0000" stop="20250422032000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">A mystery romance with a woman who wanted to have the world and a woman who risked everything for revenge.</title><desc lang="en">Snow White's Revenge</desc></programme><programme start="20250422032000 +0000" stop="20250422043500 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">A family story about five brothers and a sister-in-law who suddenly became the head of the family after her husband's unexpected death.</title><desc lang="en">For Eagle Brothers</desc></programme><programme start="20250422043500 +0000" stop="20250422044000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">The true classic of the century is born again!

While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</title><desc lang="en">The Slave Hunters</desc></programme><programme start="20250422084000 +0000" stop="20250422090000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">KBS World Daily English News  Anchor : Choi Kyu-yeon</title><desc lang="en">KBS WORLD News Today</desc></programme><programme start="20250422090000 +0000" stop="20250422095500 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">DOCU INSIGHT' is a unique program with no restrictions on materials and forms.</title><desc lang="en">DOCU INSIGHT</desc></programme><programme start="20250422095500 +0000" stop="20250422112000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">On a Friday night when a week starts and end, a talk show brings you music and stories that will "get rid of all your worries and all your concerns."</title><desc lang="en">The Seasons</desc></programme><programme start="20250422112000 +0000" stop="20250422123500 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Queen of Mystery is back!

Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness. As the season draws to a close, Grissom undergoes surgery to correct this problem, however the results of the operation remain unclear until the beginning of season four.</title><desc lang="en">CSI S3 E04 - A Little Murder</desc></programme><programme start="20250422220000 +0000" stop="20250422230000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Homicide: Life on the Street portrays the raw emotions in the life on the front line and also compels character-driven drama with emotional depth.</title><desc lang="en">Homicide: Life On The Street S2 E16 - Law &amp; Disorder</desc></programme><programme start="20250422230000 +0000" stop="20250423000000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">David Suchet portrays the inspired Belgian investigator, Hercule Poirot; creating a unique catalogue of timeless crime fiction.</title><desc lang="en">Agatha Christie's Poirot S6 E07 - Dumb Witness (Part 1)</desc></programme><programme start="20250422000000 +0000" stop="20250422003000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">News Live</desc></programme><programme start="20250422003000 +0000" stop="20250422010000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Inspirational and provocative stories providing a fresh and informative insight into the world's key events as they impact on the lives of ordinary people.</title><desc lang="en">Witness</desc></programme><programme start="20250422010000 +0000" stop="20250422013000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">News Live</desc></programme><programme start="20250422013000 +0000" stop="20250422020000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Trump takes on the U.S.'s enemies and friends - ferocious tariff wars with China and scathing rhetoric on Canada.</title><desc lang="en">The Listening Post</desc></programme><programme start="20250422020000 +0000" stop="20250422030000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">Newshour</desc></programme><programme start="20250422030000 +0000" stop="20250422033000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Up-to-date news and analysis from around the world.</title><desc lang="en">News Live</desc></programme><programme start="20250422033000 +0000" stop="20250422040000 +0000" channel="2C55AD7F-3589-48DA-BEC4-005200215975"><title lang="en">Beyond the headlines to the heart of the news of the day.
