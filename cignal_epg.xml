Pat's mission is to deliver one of Ted's inventions, a mechanical horse or “bucking bronco”, to the event. But when the bronco is accidentally switched on in the back of Pat's van, it rolls away and Pat can't find a way to recapture it. He enlists Amy's help, but jealous Pumpkin pushes the bronco away, making matters worse. Meanwhile PC Selby and Ted are each determined to be the best banjo-playing dancers Greendale (or more specifically, Dr Gilbertson) has ever seen… Pat has a great idea to catch the escaped bronco, using Dr Gilbertson's lasso-throwing skills. As Pat drives her sports car, Dr G throws the lasso - and captures the mechanical horse just in time. As she does a celebratory dance with both PC Selby and Ted, Pat is the toast of the hoe-down.

    <title lang="en">The Slave Hunters</title>
    <desc lang="en">Slaves fervently wishing to live like a human being VS. Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</desc>

There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness. As the season draws to a close, Grissom undergoes surgery to correct this problem, however the results of the operation remain unclear until the beginning of season four.</desc>
