By the time Pat realises the mixup, Ajay is airborne and can't control the powerful boots... Meanwhile Alf and Ted grow competitive as they try to win the kids' attention. Attempts to shout instructions to Ajay fail, but Pat realises Cedric could be the solution. The brave bird takes an instruction leaflet up to Ajay - who is then able to control the boots (using his toes) with ease!

Pat has to deliver special jet boots to the school, built by Ted's inventor friend. Ted will demonstrate them. But on the way to Greendale, Pat stops to help Alf, whose cows have got loose. Pat sees Ajay, out for a day's bird-watching. Pat has promised to lend Ajay his wellies and asks Ajay to get them from the van, but Ajay takes the jet boots by mistake. By the time Pat realises the mixup, Ajay is airborne and can't control the powerful boots... Meanwhile Alf and Ted grow competitive as they try to win the kids' attention. Attempts to shout instructions to Ajay fail, but Pat realises Cedric could be the solution. The brave bird takes an instruction leaflet up to Ajay - who is then able to control the boots (using his toes) with ease! Meera, Julian and the others are delighted as Ajay touches down at Greendale School with the help of Cedric - the most welcome bird Ajay has ever watched!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In CLASH OF THE TITANS, the ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation, Avatar) stars as the Greek hero Perseus in this spectacular retelling of the classic myth (and '80s cult classic film). Born of a god, but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from the clutches of Hades (Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes -- Harry Potter films), the vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, he volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Oscar nominee Liam Neeson -- Batman Begins) and unleash hell on earth. With a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will triumph only if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.</desc>
