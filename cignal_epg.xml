    <desc lang="en">The series enters its third season riding high as network television's top-rated drama. There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness. As the season draws to a close, Grissom undergoes surgery to correct this problem, however the results of the operation remain unclear until the beginning of season four.</desc>
